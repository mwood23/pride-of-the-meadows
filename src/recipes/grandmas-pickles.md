Every Christmas, we look forward to a batch of these pickles. You just can't find them in the store to get close to how Grandma does them.<!-- end --> She knows we like them so much that we started getting jars of them each holiday dinner. As the years have passed, we now each get our own jar since one jar to share didn't last through February. They take time to make, but they're well worth wait.
